# ReactGD
ReactGD is a extension tool used to create dynamic UIs with flexibility and efficiency, where the nodes are updated only when needed.

Just another prototype, this time using GDScript with better concepts

Requirements:
    - 3.5+ Godot version, as there is some neat additions for the Theme system

Objectives:
    - Make it modular, it means that any script extending any class can be a reactive component
    - Make theme applied for the component only, but apply variations for the rendered nodes
    - Custom GDX syntax, to create render tree representation using tags

Roadmap:
    - Port to 4.x, so signals can be connected to callables, enabling lambda functions support
    - Support for functional workflow, similar to ReactJS's functional components and hooks

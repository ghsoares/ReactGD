# ReactGD
ReactGD is a extension tool used to create dynamic UIs with flexibility and efficiency, where the nodes are updated only when needed.

Just another prototype, this time using GDScript with better concepts

Objectives:
    - Make it modular, it means that any script extending any class can be a reactive component
